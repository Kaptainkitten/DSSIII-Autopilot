# DSSIII-Autopilot
This is an unfinished open-source project open to all, feel free to test it out. It currently runs of AHK, which means it only has support for windows. Though, there is an older unfinished Python one, feel free to try it, it is broken though. Currently this autopilot only supports Victory ship LVL 3.
